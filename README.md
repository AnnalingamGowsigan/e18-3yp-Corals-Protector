# Corals Protector
___
Sri Lanka is an island. We have many sea resources. One of the main resources is coral reefs. For centuries, coral reefs have been a valuable resource for the people of Sri Lanka. we do not care about corals. Corals are mostly destroyed nowadays. Corals have certain environmental conditions that they need in order to survive. These factors limit where corals can live. The main factors that can affect the corals are temperature, acidity, salinity, and sunlight. If researchers or well-wishers try to find the destroying places environmental factors, they don't have any specific device to do that. So they are facing a lot of problems while taking a reading in that environment. It is also so hard to find a suitable place(with good environmental factors) for new coral growth projects.

Our device can help measure the temperature, acidity, salinity, and sunlight once and send readings to the database, which then displays them on a website with graphical analytics.
